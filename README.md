# Library-Management-System

This project develops a Library Management System which is a web-based
application developed using Python Flask. It offers a seamless experience for both
readers and administrators, enabling readers to effortlessly search for, borrow, and
return books. The system keeps track of currently borrowed books, ensuring real-time
updates on book availability. With its intuitive interface, readers can easily find the
books they need, while administrators can manage reader information, book details, and monitor current borrowing status. By focusing on current borrow status rather
than maintaining extensive borrowing and return histories, the system remains
streamlined and efficient.
